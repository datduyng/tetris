# Tetris World
# Getting start
- Try it out yourself. Download the repo and run the `.jar` file

**Goal:** Classical games involve data structure implementation in many aspect. Come ups with an efficient design for Tetris gam. This project can be improve later by applying artificial intelligence algorithm

Why implementing Tetris?
- Start simple.
- Good interview practice.
- If one understand the bare bone of an classical game theory algorithm, he or she can manipulate and build upon the game
